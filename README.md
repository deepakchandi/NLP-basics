# NLP-basics

(Work In Progress)

This repo has a few NLP projects and step by step explanation of what I have done. It starts with a simple NLP project and more complex projects will be added as we go along.

The First project I am working on is the SMS project. For this project I got the data sample which contained more than 4000 text messages which were labeled 'spam' or 'ham'. The goal was to make a model that will look at the text and tell us if the text was spam or not.
